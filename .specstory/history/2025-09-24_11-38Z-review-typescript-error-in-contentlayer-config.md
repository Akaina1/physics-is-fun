<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing TypeScript Errors**

I need to help fix TypeScript errors in contentlayer.config.ts. The user reported two errors concerning type mismatches for remark and rehype plugins. The message suggests there's a known issue with mixing major versions in the unified ecosystem. The current stack includes contentlayer 0.3.4 and several remark/rehype plugins. The mismatch between vfile versions is causing the problems, indicating that plugin types aren't aligning due to these version discrepancies. I'll need to look into aligning the versions to resolve this.
**Resolving Plugin Version Issues**

The typical fix for the errors involves upgrading or downgrading the plugin versions to align with the unified v11. I recall that the vfile major version changed between unified v10 and v11. Unified v10 uses vfile@5, while v11 uses vfile@6. The error indicates a mismatch where one plugin expects vfile 6, but another is returning vfile 5. I'll need to check if contentlayer 0.3.4 uses unified and confirm its version. I might also look into whether it involves 'mdx-bundler.'
**Clarifying Type Casting Rules**

Next 15 utilizes MDX with `mdxRs: true`, which is Rust-based. Contentlayer incorporates remark and rehype plugin arrays typed in their `mdx` config, expecting them to align with `UnifiedPlugin` from `unified`. The type mismatch might be resolvable by applying `as unknown as any` casting around the plugin functions. However, since the user specifies to never use the `<any>` type, I need to clarify if `as any` is permissible. To stay cautious, I'll avoid using any form of 'any' to align with the user's rules.
**Checking Plugin Versions for Compatibility**

I need to make sure we're using plugin versions that align with the vfile major versions. The dependencies are remark-gfm@^4.0.1, remark-math@^6.0.0, rehype-katex@^7.0.1, and rehype-pretty-code@^0.14.1. I should identify which of these uses vfile 6, especially since the error indicates a conflict between vfile@5.3.7 and vfile@6.0.3. To troubleshoot this, I'll check the resolved versions in pnpm-lock.yaml and look for any duplicates involving vfile. I'll use the grep tool to search for 'vfile@'.</details></think>

---

I'll scan your lockfile for multiple versions of `vfile` and related unified packages to confirm the version mismatch source.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing TypeScript error**

I need to look into a TypeScript error in `contentlayer.config.ts`. It shows up at lines 32 and 33, which relate to entries in the `rehypePlugins` array.

The error indicates a mismatch between VFile types from different versions, likely because of mixing unified/remark/rehype versions. I'll check the versions of remark and rehype dependencies and see that both vfile@5.3.7 and vfile@6.0.3 are installed, which is causing issues. This type mismatch is a common hurdle with these libraries.
**Resolving version conflicts**

I need to ensure that all packages in the unified ecosystem align with the same major version of vfile (typically v6, alongside unified v11 and vfile-message v4). One option is to initialize the plugin call directly instead of using the function to bypass typing issues. However, I must remember not to fall back on the any type, per user guidelines. Alternatively, calling the plugin function directly could work, but TypeScript is warning that it expects a plugin function rather than a transformer function. It's tricky!
**Unifying plugin specifications**

I need to clarify the plugin specification within the unified framework, where "plugins" can be used as either a plugin function or as an array of `[plugin, options]`. The config is expecting a "Plugin" type, which varies between unified versions 10 and 11. The TypeScript error indicates that `rehypeKatex` is being recognized as a transformer, but there's a VFile type mismatch. 

To resolve this, the simplest approach is to align all dependencies to either unified v11 with vfile v6 or unify them to v5, but it looks like I have multiple versions installed—definitely a mess!
**Identifying package dependencies**

I'm trying to find out which packages rely on vfile version 5 compared to version 6. To do this, I'll grep the lock file and check the dependencies listed there. This should help me clarify where the mismatches are coming from and guide me in fixing those version conflicts. It's a straightforward step, but I want to ensure I get the right info to make appropriate adjustments!</details></think>

---

I'll check the lockfile entries around the `vfile` versions to see which dependencies pull in v5 vs v6, and scan for unified/remark/rehype versions causing the split.

---



---



---

I'll search the lockfile for the versions and dependency trees of unified/remark/rehype and the specific plugins to identify which one pulls `vfile@5` vs `vfile@6`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating plugin compatibility**

I see there's a plugin mismatch because rehype-katex v7 uses unified 11 and vfile 6. I have a couple of options: I could downgrade rehype-katex to a version that works with unified 10, like 6.x, or I could upgrade contentlayer to match unified 11. Now, I should check the dependencies for contentlayer 0.3.4 by searching for "contentlayer" in the lock file. Let's see what we find!</details></think>

---



---



---

I'll look up which plugin versions align with unified@10 / vfile@5 so we can pin compatible versions, and confirm if contentlayer@0.3.4 expects unified@10.

I want to check the major version mapping for rehype-katex, so I'll search online for "rehype-katex v6 unified 10 vfile 5." Plus, I need to see if the lockfile shows "rehype-katex@6" is loaded; it looks like it's not present. Hmm, I should check what earlier versions exist. I'll search individually for each plugin to gather that information effectively. This way, I can piece together a clearer picture!</details></think>

I'll quickly look up which older plugin versions align with unified@10/vfile@5 so we can pin compatible versions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Aligning plugin versions**

I'm figuring out the dependencies for rehype-parse with unified 11. It seems contentlayer uses unified 10. I need to align our plugin versions accordingly. 

One option is to downgrade the plugins to fit unified 10 and vfile 5. Older versions of rehype-katex seem to depend on vfile 5, but I need to verify this. 

I'll check for earlier versions of rehype-pretty-code to find which version works with unified 10, perhaps proposing to pin it to 0.10.x or 0.12.
**Exploring plugin invocation**

I'm considering different approaches for invoking the pretty-code plugin. One option is to use `.default` to avoid typing issues. Another way is to cast it as `unknown as Plugin`, which might be permitted under user rules, but doing `as any` isn't allowed.

If I'm using `as Plugin`, it needs to match unified v10. However, there's still a type mismatch. A clearer route might be to use ESM default with the plugin invocation, especially since some errors indicate the need to treat the plugin as a function returning a transformer.
**Addressing type mismatches**

I’m seeing the “Did you mean to call this expression?” message popping up when TypeScript expects a Plugin but gets a function that isn't recognized as such. It looks like the plugin should be a creator, but there’s a type signature mismatch.

Another idea is to switch Contentlayer to a version that uses unified 11 and vfile 6, yet I see that contentlayer 0.3.4 is on unified 10. It's unclear if v0.4 is out since Contentlayer hasn’t had updates in a while. There's also an experimental option for MDX compiled by Next's RSC MDX bundler, but it seems contentlayer still relies on remark/rehype inside its pipeline. Maybe `next-contentlayer` could help integrate with `withContentlayer`.
**Finding type-checking solutions**

I'm exploring alternative methods to handle type-checking for a plugin list in tsconfig. I can consider using casts like `unknown` or `unknown as import('unified').Plugin`, but the user has banned using `any`, which complicates things. The rule states to "NEVER use the <any> type." 

While double-casting with `unknown as import('rehype').Plugin` is allowed, plugin type mismatches still occur at compile time. The expected type is `Plugin<any[], any, any>` from unified 10, compared to the plugin type from unified 11, but importing the plugin type from the same module isn’t an option either.
**Aligning plugin versions**

A better solution might be to use `as unknown as []` for the typed plugin list in the contentlayer config's `mdx.rehypePlugins`, casting it to `PluggableList` from unified v10. 

I could also create a function wrapper to call the untyped plugin, but it would return a `Transformer` typed as `any`, which I can't do. Aligning versions sounds like a good path: I want to pin `rehype-katex` to 6.x and `rehype-pretty-code` to 0.12. 

It seems like remark-gfm 4.0.1 and remark-math 6.0.0 both rely on unified 11. Since contentlayer 0.3.4 uses unified 10, I need to adjust those plugin dependencies accordingly to earlier versions that rely on unified 10 and vfile 5.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving TypeScript errors**

I need to find a solution for a TypeScript type error in the contentlayer.config.ts, specifically around rehype plugin lines. The user highlighted a couple of errors regarding type mismatch with VFile versions. 

The root cause seems to be mixing the unified v10 and v11 plugin ecosystems due to the presence of two different vfile major versions in the lockfile. It looks like unified@10 and @11 are dependent on different vfile versions, causing compatibility issues. I'll need to figure out which packages are pulling those versions.
**Analyzing plugin dependencies**

I’m trying to identify the relevant plugin lines in contentlayer.config.ts. The specified lines list the remark and rehype plugins, which include rehype-katex@7.0.1 using vfile@6.0.3 and unified v11.

It turns out that remark-related plugins, like remark-gfm@4.0.1 and remark-math@6.0.0, also rely on unified v11. However, '@mdx-js/mdx@2.3.0' depends on unified v10.1.2 and vfile 5.3.7. This creates a mismatch with Contentlayer using these plugins. In the configuration, the next.js experimental feature for MDX may complicate the compatibility further.
**Addressing version mismatches**

Contentlayer is using MDX 2.3, which relies on unified v10 and vfile v5. This creates a conflict because the remark-gfm and remark-math plugins are made for unified v11, and rehype-katex@7 relies on vfile v6. The mismatch happens because the plugins from unified v11 referencing vfile v6 don’t fit with the requirements of contentlayer that expects v5.

To fix this, I should align the plugins to work with unified v10 and vfile v5, specifically downgrading remark-gfm to version 3.x to ensure compatibility.
**Pinning plugin versions**

I see that remark-math 6 is built for unified 11, so I should pin remark-math to version 5 instead.

Rehype-katex 7 uses vfile 6, but the previous version (6) likely relied on vfile 5 and unified 10. Additionally, rehype-pretty-code 0.14 uses unified 11, while an older version (0.13) might use unified 10.

I plan to propose updating the package.json file with these pinned versions: remark-gfm@3, remark-math@5, rehype-katex@6, and rehype-pretty-code@0.12 or 0.13. However, I also wonder if I should unify everything to unified 11 by adjusting to Contentlayer 0.4, although Contentlayer hasn't been recently updated.
**Resolving TypeScript plugin compatibility**

Next's MDX mdxRs pipeline is separate from Contentlayer, which may compile MDX with unified 10. To ensure compatibility, I should use plugin versions targeting unified 10.

While I can attempt to cast plugins to 'any,' the user's guidelines explicitly forbid it. Instead, I may opt to downgrade plugins to ensure they match, such as remark-gfm@3 and rehype-pretty-code@0.10. Alternatively, I could suggest setting experimental options in Contentlayer, although this might lead to type-checking issues. 

Ultimately, the best approach seems to be proposing modifications in package.json and instructing the user on the appropriate actions to take.
**Reviewing error and proposing fixes**

The user asked me to review an error, so they might want a clear explanation and actionable fixes—likely involving code or package changes. I’ll ensure not to add any unused imports, and I won’t use 'any' types, as that's against the user's guidelines. Instead, I should focus on modifying the package.json only and not duplicating the entire file.

To stay concise, I can use code references to show the necessary changes and maintain the 2-space JSON indentation style. For instance, I could propose pinning specific plugin versions for remark-gfm, remark-math, rehype-katex, and checking rehype-pretty-code. I’ll make sure to search documentation for that last one!</details></think>

I found multiple versions of vfile (v5 and v6) in your lockfile, pulled in by unified@10 and unified@11, indicating a mismatch between plugins and Contentlayer's MDX pipeline. I'll confirm which plugin versions align with unified@10 so we can pin compatible versions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing TypeScript Error**

I need to help the user with their TypeScript error in contentlayer.config.ts. They’re importing several plugins like remarkGfm and rehypeKatex. The errors are happening at lines 32 and 33, related to the rehypePlugins array. The first error points to a function signature issue due to a version mismatch between vfile v5 and v6. The second error is similar. I've already checked the lockfile and found both versions present, which complicates things further.
**Resolving TypeScript Plugin Conflicts**

I see there’s a version conflict with the plugins due to vfile versions. The latest remark and unified versions are using vfile 6, while rehype-katex and rehype-pretty-code depend on vfile 6 as well. However, Contentlayer is relying on an earlier version of unified that uses vfile 5. This mismatch means that TypeScript is finding inconsistencies in plugin types. To resolve it, I'll need to align everything to either unified 10 and vfile 5. I'll need to check for versions of rehype-katex and rehype-pretty-code that match this.
**Inspecting Package Versions**

I need to quickly check the pnpm lock file for package structures. It shows that rehype-pretty-code 0.14.1 uses unified 11, but I might want to pin versions like 0.12.x or 0.10.x to match unified 10. I can’t rely on external memory right now, but unified 11 was released around July 2023, meaning rehype-pretty-code 0.14.x likely uses it too. I'll also consider rehype-katex, where version 6 might use vfile 5. Alternatively, I could adapt the contentlayer config, although it wouldn’t fix the underlying type mismatch completely.
**Examining Plugin Type Issues**

The plugin types are generics, and contentlayer's `mdx.rehypePlugins` expects types from `UnifiedPlugin`. However, contentlayer seems to require `Plugin<any[], any, any>` from unified 9. I can't use `as any` to cast due to rules against using the `<any>` type. While I could attempt casting to `unknown`, I still face a mismatch because of the VFile difference. It might be better to align dependency versions to either unified 10/vfile 5 or unified 11 to avoid these issues altogether.
**Strategizing Plugin Version Adjustments**

I’m considering upgrading contentlayer to support unified 11, but the current version 0.3.4 seems tied to older MDX/unified versions. Instead of upgrading, it may be better to downgrade plugin versions like rehype-katex to the 6.x line, which uses unified 10. For rehype-pretty-code, earlier versions like 0.12.5 could be viable. Even though I can use casting to address type mismatches, I need to avoid `any` types, focusing on techniques like `unknown as Plugin` for compatibility. This way, I can keep plugin versions aligned without introducing additional complexities.
**Addressing Plugin Type Issues**

I'll consider how Node resolves imports for `unified`, which could lead to picking the top-level version through PNPM's virtual store. To avoid extra imports, I might use `as unknown as never` for type matching. The error arises from how the plugin is typed, and the adjustments needed are to ensure that the plugins are provided correctly, possibly by aligning them with unified 10 or 11. I’ll need to propose specific changes to `package.json`, like pinning `rehype-katex` and `rehype-pretty-code` to older versions that relate to unified 10. It's crucial to maintain compatibility without introducing more issues.
**Proposing TypeScript Fixes**

I see that we need to fix the TypeScript errors in our `contentlayer.config.ts`. I can consider two options: a quick fix with casts for alignment or a more permanent solution by adjusting plugin versions in `package.json`. I prefer the latter since it addresses root causes. I suggest reverting `rehype-katex` and `rehype-pretty-code` to versions compatible with unified 10. I'll also provide specific PNPM commands to facilitate this change, alongside relevant explanations and minimal code adjustments to adhere to guidelines.</details></think>

Let me check which `rehype-pretty-code` versions depend on `unified@10` versus `unified@11` so I can give you exact versions to pin.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving TypeScript error**

I need to fix a TypeScript error in the contentlayer.config.ts file concerning plugin type mismatches due to VFile versions 5 and 6. I noticed the versions in package.json, where contentlayer is at 0.3.4, and next is at 15.5.4, among others. The error stack points to specific lines in the rehypePlugins array. In the lockfile, both VFile versions 5.3.7 and 6.0.3 are present, with unified using vfile at different versions. I need to pinpoint which dependencies are generating the vfile version 5.
**Identifying dependency issues**

In my grep analysis, I found that '@mdx-js/mdx' relies on unified 10.1.2 and vfile 5.3.7. Now, `rehype-katex` depends on vfile 6.0.3, whereas `rehype-pretty-code` uses unified 11.0.5. Remarkably, both `remark-gfm` and `remark-math` also depend on unified 11. So, the MDX pipeline mixes unified versions 10 and 11, causing type mismatches. The error in contentlayer.config.ts indicates the plugin expects types from vfile 6, while another plugin type from unified 10 uses vfile 5, leading to a conflict.
**Analyzing Contentlayer types**

It looks like Contentlayer may be relying on outdated unified 10 types from earlier versions of `@mdx-js/mdx`, which are associated with vfile 5. We actually passed in plugins from packages built for unified 11, leading to this type mismatch. The first error indicates that TypeScript expects a plugin type from unified 10, while 'rehype-katex' returns a plugin typed for vfile 6. This discrepancy between vfile versions 5.3.7 and 6.0.3 is at the heart of the issue, affecting both 'rehype-katex' and 'rehype-pretty-code'.
**Exploring solutions for type compatibility**

I’m considering a few solutions to resolve the type mismatch with Contentlayer and its plugins. One option is to align plugin versions to unified 10 and vfile 5 to match Contentlayer 0.3.4. Alternatively, I could explore the new MDX compile flow used in Contentlayer, although it introduces configurations that use experimental types. 

I could attempt type assertions, but since the user prefers to avoid using `any`, maybe a double cast to `unknown` as a workaround could work for this scenario. However, I'm still scanning for the best approach.
**Navigating type issues and version alignment**

I’m stuck with the user’s rule of avoiding the `any` type, which makes things complicated for my plugin typings. I can consider using `unknown` as a workaround, but there are still vfile version mismatches when trying to assign types. Contentlayer expects plugins typed for vfile 10, but I notice that some plugins, like 'rehype-katex,' might still operate on vfile 5. 

To resolve this, aligning all plugin versions to use unified 10 and vfile 5 seems like a feasible solution. However, I need to verify the exact versions of 'rehype-katex' and 'rehype-pretty-code' first.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing TypeScript Errors**

It looks like I need to help resolve a TypeScript error in the contentlayer.config.ts file. The error arises from a plugin type mismatch between rehypeKatex and rehypePrettyCode. The user's code is using contentlayer and next-contentlayer of version 0.3.4, which relies on unified version 10 and vfile version 5. However, the rehype-katex and rehype-pretty-code plugins depend on vfile version 6, causing the type conflict. This mismatch triggers the TypeScript complaint since the plugins expect types based on different versions.
**Proposing Solutions**

I need to consider solutions for the plugin type mismatch issue. Option A is to align all remark, rehype, and unified packages to version 11 and vfile to version 6 by upgrading contentlayer. But does contentlayer 0.3.4 support unified v11? It seems it might typically depend on unified 10. There might be a beta version or a config for Next's MDX-RS compiler to handle plugin types differently. 

Option B would involve pinning rehype-katex and rehype-pretty-code to versions that rely on unified 10 and vfile 5, so I need to check which versions would work.
**Understanding Plugin Compatibility**

The transition to unified v11 means it shifted to ESM only, and the types have updated to the new unist v3. It seems many plugins have also had significant updates to accommodate these changes.

For rehype-katex 7.0.1, it depends on vfile 6, while the previous major version 6.x might have aligned with unified 10 and vfile 5. Downgrading rehype-katex to 6.x could help align the types. However, both remark-gfm and remark-math depend on unified 11. This leads me to think that Contentlayer might treat its remark plugins as an unknown type, which complicates things.
**Analyzing TypeScript Errors**

The TypeScript error occurs at line 32 for rehype-katex and 33 for rehype-pretty-code. Interestingly, the remark plugins `remarkGfm` and `remarkMath` at line 30 didn't trigger diagnostics, though there might still be a type mismatch. It looks like the error is pointing to the `rehypePlugins` entry. The remark plugins might be typed as "unknown," but since they conform to unified's type definitions, they technically match.

The issue arises because Contentlayer expects a plugin type of `Plugin<any[], any, any>`, while remark gfm’s signature is `'Plugin<[Options?], Root, Root>'`. This leads to the vfile type mismatch again, as the error displayed for line 33 indicates that `'remark-pretty-code` is incompatible due to this mismatch.
**Finalizing TypeScript Plugin Solutions**

So, it seems that while the `<any>` type is banned, using `as any` is still problematic. It's safer to avoid `any` altogether. I might cast to `unknown as import('unified').Plugin` instead. The error messages suggest there may be a mismatch when passing plugin functions rather than invoking them. 

To resolve these conflicts, I’ll propose pinning versions: 
- rehype-katex to 6.0.3,

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering plugin versions**

I need to align the plugin versions to a unified 10 or update Contentlayer to use unified 11. As of now, the latest Contentlayer version is 0.3.4 from 2023. It shows a peer dependency for Next versions 12 or 13, while I'm using Next 15. That's odd, but the experimental `withContentlayer` might still function with Next 15. Yet, I’m worried about potential mismatched versions causing issues. One option could be to downgrade `remark-gfm` to a version compatible with unified 10. I'll need to look more into that.
**Examining rehype versions**

I might consider downgrading `rehype-katex` to a previous major version, possibly `rehype-katex@6.x`, which likely used unified 10. I didn’t find specifics through the web search tool. However, looking at the lockfile, `rehype-katex@7.0.1` uses vfile 6.0.3, suggesting that the 6.x version might use vfile 5. I also see that `rehype-pretty-code` uses unified 11, so I should find an earlier version, like `0.10.x` or `0.9.x`, to align with unified 10 without breaking dependencies.
**Revising Contentlayer config**

I could change the Contentlayer config to call the plugin functions directly instead of passing the module itself. However, I’m seeing an error about calling an expression. This seems to stem from TypeScript’s type signature complaining about how I'm using the plugin variable. While calling the plugin does return a `Transformer`, the MDX plugin needs the function or the [plugin, options] format. 

Maybe the better approach would be to set `mdxRs: true` in `next.config.ts`, allowing Next to compile MDX instead of relying on Contentlayer. This setup looks intentional for better compatibility.
**Proposing pinned versions**

I think we need to propose specific versions for the packages we’re using. For `remark-gfm`, the version `3.0.1` probably aligns with unified 10, although our lockfile only shows `4.0.1` right now. We can suggest changing it to "remark-gfm": "^3.0.1" in package.json.

As for `remark-math`, maybe versions before 6, like `5.1.1`, would work. For `rehype-katex`, I believe `^6.0.3` is suitable. Lastly, for `rehype-pretty-code`, I might propose using `0.10.1`, but I should double-check its history on GitHub for assurance. I'll refine my search queries for that too.
**Aligning plugin versions**

I’m thinking about proposing specific pinned versions for the plugins to align with unified 10. For example, I can recommend using `remark-gfm@3`, `remark-math@5`, `rehype-katex@6`, and perhaps an earlier version of `rehype-pretty-code`, maybe `0.12`. 

I realize that forcing older versions could lead to runtime issues, especially since some plugins expect API changes from unified 11. Another approach might be to adjust our Contentlayer configuration to wrap plugin types correctly, although we need to be careful about type safety and TypeScript requirements. We also might need to add ‘shiki’ explicitly as it’s a peer dependency for `rehype-pretty-code`.
**Proposing plugin version fixes**

I’m considering how to deal with type mismatches we’re facing. We could potentially use `// @ts-expect-error` to bypass the type checks, but that doesn't sit well since the user prefers against `<any>`. Instead, we should suggest pinning the plugin versions to older, compatible ones.

I’m recommending:
- `remark-gfm@3.0.1`
- `remark-math@5.1.1`
- `rehype-katex@6.0.3`
- `rehype-pretty-code@0.12.3`

Additionally, we need to ensure to run `pnpm add -D` for these dependencies and consider adding a compatible version of `shiki`. I'll provide all commands and a summary to guide the user in making these adjustments effectively.
**Outlining the fix approach**

We have a few issues with mixed versions causing TypeScript errors. 'rehype-pretty-code' needs 'shiki' to be installed, but we should ensure the right version. I’m suggesting adding `shiki@^1` as a dev dependency. Then, I'll propose the command `pnpm add -D shiki@^1 rehype-pretty-code@0.12 remark-gfm@3 remark-math@5 rehype-katex@6`.

For verification, run `pnpm ls vfile` to check if only v5 appears. If they prefer not downgrading, they could consider moving to MDX with unified 11. Lastly, I’ll call out the specific lines in `contentlayer.config.ts` where the type issues arise.</details></think>

---

I inspected your deps/lockfile. You have mixed unified/vfile majors: Contentlayer’s MDX stack pulls unified@10 → vfile@5, while your plugins pull unified@11 → vfile@6. That mismatch causes the TS2322 error at these lines:

```29:35:contentlayer.config.ts
  mdx: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm, remarkMath],
    rehypePlugins: [
      [rehypeKatex, { trust: true, strict: false }],
      [rehypePrettyCode, { theme: "github-dark" }],
    ],
  },
```

Fix by pinning unified@10-era plugin versions:

- remark-gfm: 3.x
- remark-math: 5.x
- rehype-katex: 6.x
- rehype-pretty-code: 0.12.x (requires shiki 1.x)

Run these commands:

```bash
pnpm add remark-gfm@^3 remark-math@^5 rehype-katex@^6 rehype-pretty-code@^0.12 shiki@^1
pnpm install
pnpm dedupe
```

Then restart the TS server (or your editor). Verify there’s only one vfile major:

```bash
pnpm ls vfile
```

If you prefer a temporary unblock without changing versions, add a ts-expect-error above the two rehype plugin entries, but the correct fix is aligning versions.

- Aligned plugin deps to unified@10/vfile@5 to match Contentlayer’s MDX pipeline.
- Provided exact versions and commands; error should clear on lines 32–33 in `contentlayer.config.ts`.

_**User (2025-09-24 11:07Z)**_

would it not be better to latest versions (unified 11, vfile6, remark 15, rehype 13) rather than go back down to unified 10?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing upgrade options**

I need to figure out whether it's better for the user to upgrade to the latest major versions (unified 11, vfile 6, remark 15, rehype 13) instead of downgrading to unified 10. First, I’ll check compatibility with Contentlayer 0.3.4 and the Next Contentlayer plugin. It seems like Contentlayer integrates MDX through the unified pipeline, using unified 10 in earlier versions. The pnpm-lock shows the current dependencies with unified 10 and vfile 5. I’m curious if the upcoming versions will fully support unified 11.
**Evaluating Contentlayer compatibility**

It looks like Contentlayer 0.3.4 uses mdx v2.3.0 and unified 10.1.2, so upgrading to unified 11 while keeping Contentlayer on unified 10 would lead to a compatibility mismatch. I need to check if there's a new version of Contentlayer that uses unified 11. There's also the aspect of Next 15's 'experimental mdxRs: true' using mdx-rs, which might bypass the unified pipeline. If the user wants to unify everything to unified 11 and vfile 6, I’ll need to ensure that both Contentlayer and '@mdx-js/mdx' versions align accordingly.
**Considering Contentlayer upgrades**

Contentlayer 0.3.4 is using '@mdx-js/mdx' version 2.3.0, so upgrading would probably need new versions of Contentlayer. It looks like the current stable version won’t allow us to move to unified 11. Force-resolutions to dedupe everything to vfile 6 might actually break the runtime for '@mdx-js/mdx' 2. The safest option seems to be downgrading plugin versions to unified 10. I need to explain to the user that upgrading requires migrating to a new major version of Contentlayer or using mdx 3. There's also a note about peerDependencies with 'next-contentlayer'—that's intriguing!
**Examining version compatibility**

The lock file indicates that 'next-contentlayer' has peerDependencies set for Next ^12 or ^13, but we’ve got Next 15.5.4 installed. Despite that mismatch, it seems to be working, even though 'next-contentlayer' 0.3.4 hasn’t been tested with Next 15 or unified 11. Upgrading to the latest unified version is likely incompatible. I’m considering the idea of removing Contentlayer, but the user relies on it for MDX data. I might suggest using 'rehype-pretty-code@0.14' that utilizes unified 11 because the current issue seems tied to the plugin lines expecting parameters typed to vfile 6.
**Exploring plugin compatibility issues**

The mismatch between types can't be fixed simply by using type casts like `as unknown as Plugin`. I remember the user’s rule about avoiding `<any>`, so I can't use that method. However, I can import the `Plugin` type from 'unified' for casting. The ongoing issue might not be resolved since TypeScript checks generic parameter types, and there's a difference between vfile versions. If the plugin expects vfile 6 types while receiving vfile 5, it could still work. Ultimately, the best solution seems to be aligning plugin versions to unified 10 or upgrading to Contentlayer that supports unified 11. I’ll check if Contentlayer 0.4 exists by doing a web search for "contentlayer unified 11."</details></think>

---

I'll check if the currently used Contentlayer version supports unified@11/vfile@6, and whether there's a newer Contentlayer release that does, to advise on upgrading vs pinning older plugin versions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Contentlayer updates**

As of my last knowledge in October 2024, it looks like Contentlayer hasn't had significant updates recently, with 0.3.4 being the latest version. Around 2023, unified v11 was introduced. Many plugins have moved to unified v11, but Contentlayer 0.3.x still uses unified 10. To upgrade everything using Contentlayer's pipeline, we might need to wait for updates or shift to using the Next.js MDX pipeline. I’m curious about the implications of keeping the unified 11 plugin versions in the configuration.
**Resolving type mismatches**

I’m encountering a type mismatch issue due to differences in vfile types, which makes it tricky to fix easily. TypeScript is complaining, but there’s a chance they might work at runtime. While I could cast to `any` or use `as unknown as Plugin`, the user's rules say to avoid `any` entirely. Instead, I could consider unknown casts, but I still face compile-time mismatches. Another approach might be to unify to vfile 6 across the tree using `resolutions`, though this risks breaking dependencies with unified@10.
**Assessing vfile compatibility and options**

Sometimes vfile 6 can be backwards compatible, but there are type changes with vfile-message 4 causing mismatches. I’m considering removing Contentlayer to use MDX directly in Next.js with either next-mdx-remote or @next/mdx, though Contentlayer helps in building content indexes. A middle ground approach would be to stick with plugin versions compatible with unified 10. If the user prefers upgrading to the latest unified 11, I should explain that they can migrate MDX compilation from Contentlayer, focusing on data extraction instead.
**Exploring Contentlayer and alternatives**

Contentlayer's `makeSource` integrates the MDX pipeline, but I’m uncertain if it can be configured to omit the MDX plugin integration; it probably needs a plugin array. If we set mdx_options with empty plugins, Contentlayer might still use mdx@2/unified version 10, preventing mismatches if we align plugins accordingly. If we aim for unified 11, Contentlayer would need to support that too, though there isn't likely a 0.4 pre-release. Alternatively, I could consider replacing Contentlayer with options like Velite, Markdoc, or Nextra’s utilities, keeping changes minimal.
**Proposing options for Contentlayer**

We have two main options to consider. The first option is to stay on Contentlayer 0.3.4 and pin older plugin versions, which I recommend for a quick fix. This would align with unified 10 without causing errors. The second option is to switch to Next's MDX route by removing Contentlayer, using `@next/mdx`, or `next-mdx-remote`. This would allow for unified 11 usage but would require careful consideration of how to handle content indexing. 

Given the user's goal of using the latest versions, I'd suggest investigating an upgrade to Velite or a new Contentlayer release if available. However, if we stick with Contentlayer, reliable use of unified 11 isn't possible without a possible upgrade.
**Summarizing options for Contentlayer and MDX**

We identified a couple of paths forward. If the user wants to upgrade to unified 11, one option is to drop Contentlayer's MDX pipeline and use Next's MDX with plugin arrays. Alternatively, they could keep Contentlayer but avoid plugin arrays to eliminate type mismatch issues. This means using Contentlayer for frontmatter and raw content, then processing it at render time. Pinning to unified 10 is recommended for now to minimize complexity and avoid needing larger refactoring. It’s important to weigh the trade-offs!
**Clarifying Contentlayer and plugin versions**

Short answer: You cannot use the latest versions while on Contentlayer 0.3.4, as it hard-pins unified@10. To upgrade, you have two options: (A) swap Contentlayer for a solution that supports unified@11, or (B) keep Contentlayer just for metadata, compiling MDX separately. Given your setup, it's safer to pin plugin majors to unified 10. 

For Option 1, stay with Contentlayer: 

- Use these pnpm commands to pin versions. 

For Option 2, upgrade: 

- Remove plugin arrays from contentlayer.config.ts and add the @next/mdx plugin to next.config.ts. 

If you want the latest plugins, you'll need to move away from Contentlayer.</details></think>

### Short answer
Not while you’re on Contentlayer 0.3.x. It’s tied to unified 10/vfile 5 via its MDX toolchain. Mixing in unified 11/vfile 6 plugins causes the exact type split you’re seeing.

### Your options
- Option A (minimal, stable): Keep Contentlayer and pin plugins to the unified 10 era.
  - remark-gfm 3.x, remark-math 5.x, rehype-katex 6.x, rehype-pretty-code 0.12.x (with shiki 1.x).
  - Commands:
    ```bash
    pnpm add remark-gfm@^3 remark-math@^5 rehype-katex@^6 rehype-pretty-code@^0.12 shiki@^1
    pnpm install && pnpm dedupe
    ```
- Option B (go latest): Move off Contentlayer’s MDX pipeline.
  - Keep Contentlayer only for data (or replace it entirely), and compile MDX yourself with unified 11/vfile 6 (e.g., next-mdx-remote or a custom build step). This avoids the type split but is a larger refactor.

If you want latest everything with minimal churn, I recommend Option A now; we can plan a migration to a unified 11-based pipeline later.

- Contentlayer 0.3.x hard-depends on unified 10/vfile 5.
- Upgrading plugins alone won’t work; align either down (keep CL) or migrate the MDX pipeline to go up.
