# Fix theme toggle animation issue (2025-10-07 18:11Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 15:45Z)**_

@ThemeToggle.tsx @globals.css 

I have a theme toggle component here that is structured like a clock dial where we have 2 icons;

sun = light mode
moon = dark mode

we have a larger rotating dial that rotates the icons +180 degrees when the toggle is clicked.

We have an issue with our view transitions that make it so the dial rotation animiation is covered or something by the theme fade transition.

For example if i am on dark mode and the moon is showing, it SHOULD rotate out clockwise while the sun rotates in.

BUT, the moon does not move at all and looks like it fades out, THEN the sun rotates in.

Can you identify the issue

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing CSS and animations**

I need to analyze the code and CSS to understand why the dial rotation animation is being obscured by the theme fade transition. This involves looking at the `document.startViewTransition` and the CSS rules for view transitions. They use an animation duration of 1000ms and an ease-in-out timing function. The theme toggle function includes logic for using view transitions if supported, which captures a snapshot for animation. It seems like the rotating dial animation is inside the button, leading to this issue.
**Understanding view transitions**

In the view transition spec, the entire document root animates, including pseudo-elements like `html::view-transition-old(root)` and new root overlays. During the transition, the actual DOM may be covered by a screenshot overlay, making any DOM animations invisible. The rotation happens but is hidden by this overlay, giving the impression that elements like the moon are static while the sun rotates. To resolve this, I should exclude the button or rotating dial from the transition capturing or opt-out of certain elements, while coordinating with the code structure.
**Animating UI independently**

To animate the UI independently during a view transition, I have a couple of options. I could either delay the dial's rotation until the view transition ends, ensuring it's not masked, or I could animate the dial using the view transition method instead of CSS transforms. Alternatively, I could opt out of the view transition for the toggle button or dial by setting `view-transition-name: none`. However, this raises questions about whether the overlay still covers everything, even if the dial isn't participating in the transition.
**Understanding document transitions**

When a document transition occurs, the old snapshot covers the viewport and cross-fades with the new snapshot. Non-participating elements may still appear in these snapshots unless specified with `view-transition-name: none`, which means they're not actively transitioning but could still be included. There's no dedicated overlay for these elements, as they remain part of the snapshots. To ensure certain elements appear on top, I could use `position: fixed` with a high `z-index` to keep them visually above the transition.
**Identifying view transition issues**

The main issue is that the document view transition overlay masks the dial's rotation, making it hidden during the theme toggle. To resolve this, I could either move the rotation outside the view transition entirely or customize the transition to allow the dial to be a shared element that remains visible. We can also consider adjusting CSS properties such as `mix-blend-mode` or clip-paths to avoid covering the dial area. Providing a concise direction for this will help clarify the situation without going into excessive detail about fixes.
**Identifying view transition issues**

The rotation of the dial is masked by the page-level view transition overlay. By invoking `startViewTransition` and updating `rotation` inside the callback, the browser captures a static snapshot of the dial while the root pseudo-elements crossfade over the viewport, making it invisible. 

The relevant code references include lines 52-59 from `ThemeToggle.tsx` and lines 268-274 in `globals.css`. The overlay masks the dial animation, causing it to appear that the moon fades out before the sun rotates in. 

To address this issue, the user could either skip view transitions for theme toggles, make the dial a shared element in the transition, or rotate the dial after the transition ends.
**Summarizing the view transition issue**

Here's a brief summary of the situation:

- **Root cause**: The document View Transition covers the viewport with `::view-transition-old(root)` and `::view-transition-new(root)` for 1000ms, making the dial's transform invisible. Updating rotation within the transition callback captures it as a snapshot rather than as an animation.

- **Options**: 1) Avoid using `startViewTransition`, fallback to the `.changing-theme`. 2) Disable the root transition with `html::view-transition-old(root), html::view-transition-new(root) { animation: none; }`. 3) Convert the dial to a shared element using `view-transition-name: theme-dial` to animate it properly.</details></think>

### Root cause
The page-level View Transition is covering your dial. You’re calling `document.startViewTransition(...)` and changing `rotation` inside its callback, so the browser takes “before/after” screenshots and cross-fades them using `html::view-transition-old(root)`/`new(root)`. That full-viewport overlay sits on top for 1000ms (per your CSS), so the live dial transform is hidden; the moon appears to fade (snapshot), then the sun’s rotation only becomes visible after the overlay ends.

### Where it’s coming from
```52:59:src/app/_components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx
    if (document.startViewTransition && !reduceMotion) {
      document.startViewTransition(() => {
        // Apply DOM change inside the callback so the browser snapshots properly
        applyTheme(next);
        document.cookie = `theme=${next}; path=/; max-age=31536000; samesite=lax`;
        setTheme(next);
        setRotation((r) => r + 180);
      });
    } else {
```

```268:274:src/app/globals.css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  html::view-transition-old(root),
  html::view-transition-new(root) {
    animation-duration: 1000ms;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  }
}
```

### What to change (any one of these)
- Disable the root view transition for this interaction and use your `.changing-theme` fallback, so the dial’s CSS rotation remains visible.
- Or, turn off the root cross-fade and make the dial a shared element (`view-transition-name: theme-dial`) and animate `::view-transition-* (theme-dial)` instead.
- Or, trigger the dial rotation after `transition.finished` (it will rotate after the fade, not during).

- The dial rotation is hidden because the root view-transition overlay cross-fades the entire page for 1000ms while you change `rotation` inside the transition callback.

try implementing option 1 first, then i can test. if it doesn't work we will try option 2

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing theme transitions**

I need to implement "option 1," which involves disabling the root view transition for this interaction and using the fallback `.changing-theme` CSS transitions. The current setup uses document.startViewTransition with a 1000ms fade, but the root transition overlays everything. So, I should modify ThemeToggle.tsx to prevent calling document.startViewTransition during the toggle, instead just applying the theme and using the existing `.changing-theme` transitions. Essentially, I'm looking to detect when to use view transitions and set it to false if needed.
**Revising transition implementation**

I'm considering another approach where I could either remove the if block or use setTimeout for rotation after the overlay. However, since the instruction is to implement option 1, I’ll modify the code to avoid calling document.startViewTransition for now while keeping the fallback code path. I’ll make sure to add the `.changing-theme` class to the root, execute applyTheme, set the cookie, and handle everything else, ensuring no overlays interfere. This should streamline things nicely!
**Applying CSS for transitions**

I need to ensure that any CSS for fading is only applied when the `.changing-theme` class is present. The existing CSS already covers that. For a potential edge case, I see the current code updates the rotation in both branches, which means I'll need to either remove the startViewTransition branch or add a constant to disable it. If I set `USE_VIEW_TRANSITION_FOR_THEME_TOGGLE = false`, then I can adjust the logic accordingly while also remembering that cookie storage is already handled. Since we won’t trigger view transitions for toggle, it should be fine!
**Managing theme transitions**

I’m planning to add the `.changing-theme` class to the root and remove it after the 1000ms timeout, keeping things consistent. Since the task is small—a single file edit—I’ve decided against creating a todo list, as the tool_spec allows us to skip that for smaller tasks. However, I still need to provide a status update when calling `apply_patch` on the file for updates. Also, I'll follow the "Citing code" rule by only referencing necessary code blocks for important changes without repeating the entire file.
**Updating view transitions**

I’ve decided we can just say we updated the condition to disable view transitions without needing to show specific code references. The markup spec allows code references, but only if necessary. Since the user asked for an implementation, it’s better to avoid showing the code itself unless requested. I’ll mention, “I disabled the root View Transition in `ThemeToggle.tsx` by gating.” 

Next, I’ll perform tool calls to read the file and apply the patch, including necessary context lines. I’ll add the new constant and update the condition to reflect this change while ensuring proper indentation. I'll verify the exact lines by reading the file first.</details></think>

---

I'll disable the root View Transition for the theme toggle so it always uses the `.changing-theme` CSS fallback, ensuring the dial rotation remains visible. I'll update `ThemeToggle.tsx` to gate off `document.startViewTransition`, then check for linter issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing code changes**

I need to use option 1: disable the root View Transition specifically for this interaction while using the .changing-theme fallback to ensure the dial's CSS rotation is visible. The previous assistant mentioned updating `ThemeToggle.tsx` to prevent the `document.startViewTransition` call. Instead, we’ll use the fallback to manage CSS transitions. The code currently checks if `document.startViewTransition` is available and whether reduce motion settings are enabled before deciding which path to take.
**Considering view transitions**

I might also need to add `view-transition-name: none` to the HTML to prevent any weird overlays if other transitions are triggered. While I won't be calling `startViewTransition`, some code might still trigger view transitions during theme toggles. However, I believe that root view transitions need an explicit call. I also need to remember not to use the `.lean()` mention since it’s not relevant here. For this simple edit, I realize I don’t actually need the todo_write tool since it’s just a single step task.
**Updating code with tools**

I need to provide status updates when I use tools, so I’ll have to call `edit_file` or `apply_patch` to modify the `ThemeToggle.tsx` file. I'll use `apply_patch` to update the necessary lines while ensuring I read the file again before doing so. According to the instructions, we already read the file. I’m considering adjusting CSS durations, but since we’re disabling the root view transition, we might not need to touch CSS. After editing, I’ll use `read_lints` to check for code style adherence and avoid unused imports.
**Planning the code change**

I need to plan the change in the `toggleTheme` function. The goal is to remove the `if (document.startViewTransition && !reduceMotion)` branch and always run the fallback. Instead, we can update the logic to `if (!reduceMotion) { // fallback }` for clarity, but to keep it simple, I’ll replace the existing branch with `if (false && document.startViewTransition && !reduceMotion) { ... }`. 

However, it's better to remove that branch for cleaner code. I’ll directly add the classes and apply the theme, ensuring to respect the `reduceMotion` setting for immediate updates without transitions when necessary.
**Preparing the patch update**

The original fallback block didn’t separate reduceMotion, and it was mainly used for SVT triggers. However, we do have CSS with `.changing-theme` that disables transitions, which might allow it to be added during reduceMotion scenarios. I'm planning to implement a slight improvement without adding unnecessary code. I’ll prepare an apply_patch for `ThemeToggle.tsx`, focusing on lines 52 to 60 while ensuring whitespace consistency. 

I’ll replace the conditional branches with an unconditional fallback and ensure we keep everything else tidy. After crafting the patch, I’ll run read_lints to check for any issues.</details></think>

---

I’m going to remove the `startViewTransition` usage from `ThemeToggle.tsx` so the toggle always uses the CSS `.changing-theme` fallback, which should keep the dial’s rotation visible. Then I’ll run a quick linter check on the changed file.

- I disabled the root View Transition usage and forced the CSS-based `.changing-theme` path in `ThemeToggle.tsx`, so the dial rotation should remain visible during theme toggles.

Please test the toggle:
- Click the dial while in dark mode; the moon should rotate out as the sun rotates in (and vice versa).
- Reduced-motion users still won’t get extra transitions, but the dial rotation state updates.

- Edits: `ThemeToggle.tsx` now always applies theme changes via the `.changing-theme` fallback rather than `document.startViewTransition`.

_**User (2025-10-07 15:45Z)**_

there is no rotation at all the icons just switches instantly

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting theme transition**

I'm considering the icons switching instantly, where the sun appears while the moon disappears. It might relate to the reduceMotion gating. If reduceMotion is false, I’m adding a changing theme and setting rotation in increments. But, hmm, the root could have 'motion-reduce: transition-none' applied. The user probably doesn’t have reduced motion enabled, but now there’s “no rotation at all.” I suspect the transformation styles on the sun and moon icons might affect the rotation state as both rotate together, which should be okay.
**Examining theme transition issues**

I’m thinking about how the .changing-theme class might apply transitions to 'fill' and 'stroke,' which may not directly impact the transform but could interact with it. It's not the most likely issue. The user mentioned the icons switch instantly, which suggests that the rotation state is quickly set to rotation + 180, but maybe the CSS transition isn't taking effect because the 'transform' property changed. React should animate these updates, but perhaps the 'will-change: transform' property is needed? However, that doesn’t seem necessary. Alternatively, the view transition overlay might still be causing issues.
**Considering view transitions**

I’m pondering if Next.js uses automatic view transitions for theme changes. The startViewTransition is only triggered by the code, while CSS for the pseudo-element needs animations to exist. Without it, nothing will happen. Initially, the rotation used startViewTransition, but that was removed. Now, the dial doesn’t rotate, possibly because I set transforms on both the rotating container and the icons. If the container rotates 180 degrees and the icons also rotate by the same amount, they could end up canceling each other out. I wonder how that affects their visual orientation.
**Analyzing icon rotation**

I’m considering how the icons are positioned absolutely at the top and bottom of the dial container. When the container rotates, it shifts their positions around the center. If the icons also rotate, it affects their orientation, but the core effect should really be their position moving along the circle. If both rotate by the same angle, the icons should maintain their orientation relative to the viewport. However, the net transformation of the child icon will be affected by the simultaneous rotations, potentially leading to a double angle effect. The key is that the container's rotation needs to be visible, yet the user mentioned that the icons "switch instantly," not fade.
I'm examining whether the 'transition-transform' class is being overshadowed by 'motion-reduce: transition-none' due to the 'prefers-reduced-motion: reduce' setting in the user's OS. Earlier, they saw a fade effect, which suggests no reduce motion was active at that time. It's possible that React unmounts and remounts the dial content, triggering theme state updates, but the rotation might not be animated due to CSS overriding properties. The main issue seems to be that the 'changing-theme' class impacts transform transitions. I need to ensure transitions for the dial and icons remain intact.
I’m considering how CSS rules cascade, and that the later rules will override earlier ones when tie-breaking on specificity. Since our '.changing-theme' is defined earlier than Tailwind's 'transition-transform', the latter is overridden by the former. Instead of applying transition settings globally, I could focus on color transitions specifically. To ensure the dial rotates smoothly, I need to adjust the CSS to preserve transform transitions. Setting specific rules like ‘transition: transform 700ms ease-in-out’ directly on the dial could solve the rotation issue without disrupting other transitions. I’ll avoid using shorthand to maintain clarity.
I'm figuring out how to apply CSS transitions effectively, particularly with the '.changing-theme' class. In CSS, the last defined rule takes precedence, so I need to ensure 'transform' is included in the transition properties to maintain rotation animations. Setting different durations for each property can be tricky, but I could simplify by establishing 'transform 700ms ease-in-out' in the global transition list. It's crucial to manage how these transitions might interact with other animated elements, like nebula drifts, to ensure everything works smoothly. I’m ready to implement these changes and test them out!</details></think>

---

I'll modify the `.changing-theme` transitions to also include `transform` so the dial's rotation isn't suppressed by the global transition override. Then you can test again.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying icon transition**

We need to address the user's observation that the icons switch instantly without rotation. Initially, we implemented Option 1, which disabled startViewTransition and utilized a CSS fallback. The user confirmed no rotation occurred. We then modified `globals.css` to include a transform transition under `.changing-theme, .changing-theme *`. I need to verify if that change is adequate. The dial rotation relies on the inline style transform for both the dial and the icons, which should create a smooth effect.
**Analyzing transition issues**

I’m considering why the transitions aren't working as expected. The previous classes should have triggered transitions, but disabling startViewTransition might have altered the update order. We toggled the `.changing-theme` class and set the rotation state within the same microtask. The dial has a 'transition-transform' class, so it should animate. But the user reports no rotation, which might happen if rotation state changes are applied synchronously. I’m also pondering if the 'prefers-reduced-motion' setting could be affecting this. These classes come from Tailwind, and 'motion-reduce' disables transitions when needed.
**Investigating transition overrides**

I’m considering how the transition properties are set up. The `.changing-theme *` adds new transition properties, which might be overshadowing the earlier 'transition-transform.' When you specify a transition property again, it can override existing properties. The 'transition-transform' sets it up for transforms, while `.changing-theme *` resets it, which includes the transform property. But even with a proper duration of 700ms, the user reported no rotation, suggesting the transform might not be applied correctly or perhaps the icons changed due to other visual elements rather than the rotation.
**Revisiting transition logic**

I’m considering the changes made to skip 'startViewTransition.' We added logic that handles rotation depending on motion preferences. If 'reduceMotion' is true, we apply the theme and rotation without adding 'changing-theme.' However, when it’s not, we do add that class and set everything up. If 'motion-reduce' is enabled, it disables the transitions, causing the icons to switch instantly without any animation, which may explain the user's experience. Additionally, I realize that both the dial and icons might be rotating, which could create an unintended effect of double rotation.
**Investigating rotation issues**

I'm analyzing why the rotation isn't working as expected. Previously, it functioned with 'startViewTransition', allowing for smoother animations. Now, the toggling theme logic might be causing issues with the dial's rotation. The change in theme may apply a transition that affects the rotation's animation, possibly due to the 'transition: ... transform 700ms' in the `.changing-theme` class. It seems the icons also rotate, but since they share the same rotation style, they might appear static as they maintain their orientation. It could also be that transitions are disabled for those who prefer reduced motion, but the user didn't mention their settings.
**Examining icon rotation issues**

I’m exploring why the rotation seems absent.  It could be that the reduced motion setting is affecting how the rotation displays, as we have classes that disable transitions for reduced motion. If enabled, the icons switch instantly, which matches what the user described. However, since both the dial and icons rotate simultaneously, they may appear static relative to the viewport. 

Another possibility is that the `changing-theme` class might be overshadowing transitions. I need to verify if the transformation is being applied correctly, especially since rotation state is set on mount and should trigger animations normally.
**Analyzing rotation issues further**

I'm looking into why the rotation isn't happening. There may be an overlay effect, given CSS settings that apply a view transition of 1000ms. I wonder if the icons are seen switching instantly because of the `reduceMotion` setting, which disables transitions. If that's true, it matches the user’s description. 

It's also possible that the `changing-theme` class is causing a conflict with transition properties, overshadowing the animation. I need to verify if the rotation state updates correctly, especially since the icons rotate in tandem with the dial, which might prevent noticeable movement.
**Exploring transform issues in Tailwind**

I’m digging into how the rotation isn’t displaying properly in Tailwind. It seems there could be a misconfiguration since the transform utility might be missing. Without it, the inline style for rotation may be taking precedence and causing issues with translations. I'm considering if the transitions might be conflicting, leading to an instant switch rather than an animation. Additionally, if the rotation state updates but the UI behaves as if it’s not animating, it could point to an issue in how styles are being applied. I need to confirm the behavior under various settings.
**Analyzing the rotation issue in Tailwind**

I’m considering the possible reasons why the dial rotation isn't showing up. The dial container's inline transform likely overrides the Tailwind translation properties, causing animations to fail. I'm thinking about whether the user's environment (like reduced motion preferences) might affect the display. It’s crucial to ensure the transition property is properly applied. I also wonder if we could combine CSS variables to simplify how rotation and translation are handled. This might avoid conflicts and ensure proper animations. I think I should confirm the user’s settings and maybe propose adjustments if necessary.
**Testing transitions with reduce motion**

I'm considering the next steps to address the transition issues. I think it might be a good idea to remove `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` from our CSS temporarily, just to see if that resolves the motion display problems. However, doing this might disable the transitions for users who prefer reduced motion.

I should also make sure our JavaScript checks the `reduceMotion` setting, so we avoid applying the changing-theme class when that preference is true. Additionally, I'll remove unnecessary `motion-reduce:transition-none` classes from our dial and icons, which should ensure they animate properly, even for users with reduced motion settings. I want to make sure we maintain accessibility while implementing these fixes.</details></think>

---

I'll remove the `motion-reduce:transition-none` classes from the rotating elements to ensure the rotation animation runs even if the OS prefers reduced motion, then check for linter issues.

- I updated `.changing-theme` to transition `transform` so the dial rotation animates during theme fades.
- I also removed `motion-reduce:transition-none` from the rotating elements so their rotation isn’t disabled unintentionally.

Please test again. If the rotation still doesn’t appear, we’ll proceed to option 2 (shared element via view transitions).

_**User (2025-10-07 15:45Z)**_

nope we have to use view transitions, we used them due to our mdx posts having complex logic and components. without view transitions the theme switching when on a blog post is super laggy.

I have reverted all changes@ThemeToggle.tsx @globals.css 

We will need to try option 2 so we keep view transitions

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing view transitions**

I need to implement option 2, which involves using view transitions while keeping the dial rotation visible. The approach is to use shared element view transition names so the dial continues animating during overlays. With the Chrome View Transitions API, we can apply `view-transition-name` in CSS for shared elements while ensuring parts can animate using `::view-transition-old(name)` and `::view-transition-new(name)`. It’s crucial to position the live DOM behind the overlay and cleverly manage the pseudo-elements for effective transition.
**Understanding animation with pseudo-elements**

The animation runs on pseudo-elements that capture before and after states but don't display dynamic transforms applied during transitions. Since snapshots happen at two specific times, any CSS transforms on the main element won’t be visible. However, we can animate transformations on the pseudo-elements using a CSS timeline for rotation. The earlier issue was that we set rotation within the startViewTransition callback, causing the “old” snapshot to miss live changes. Only the pseudo-elements end up showing animated rotations.
**Animating rotation in transitions**

To animate the icon's rotation during the view transition, I need to focus on the transforms of the pseudo-elements, rotating them from 0 to 180 degrees. This means I can't rely on the live transform but will set up a CSS animation using snapshots instead. I’ll add `view-transition-name` to the dial wrapper as `'theme-dial'`. Then, I’ll define keyframes for rotating in a clockwise direction based on theme changes. The pseudo-elements `::view-transition-old(theme-dial)` and `::view-transition-new(theme-dial)` will receive the rotation animations.
**Setting CSS for transitions**

I'm looking at an example CSS setup to address theme dial animations. I need to ensure the transform origin is correct since snapshots may already have transforms applied. We want to coordinate initial transforms. At time t0, I must determine if the dial's current rotation is 0 or 180 degrees. I have a rotation variable in code that toggles +180 each time. For instance, if dark mode is showing a moon at 180, the wrapper style must reflect that pre-change rotation accurately.
**Implementing theme dial transitions**

In the callback, when I set the rotation to +180, the new snapshot shows this rotated state. However, I really want to animate the rotation instead of just cross-fading. To achieve this, I’ll animate the old snapshot rotating out and the new snapshot rotating in, starting from opposite offset values. I'll need to ensure the element is a single stacking context, possibly using `contain: paint` for proper layering. It's also essential that I set the same `view-transition-name` for both the old and new states, allowing them to animate correctly. Now, I’ll plan my code updates accordingly.
**Refining dial transition handling**

I might need to disable cross-fading for the dial group since its pseudo-elements usually cross-fade by default. I want to ensure that my animations take precedence. To maintain consistency, I'll match the dial animations to the rotation duration of 700ms. When I toggle the theme and call `setRotation`, the old and new snapshots must rotate appropriately to create a seamless transition. I'll prepare the CSS to implement the animations and ensure the icons rotate with the dial. Finally, I’ll create a small TODO list for the necessary updates in my code.
**Implementing status updates and changes**

The status update spec requires me to provide micro updates before making tool calls. I need to keep the indentation style consistent, matching the CSS file's two spaces per indent. First, I’ll apply a patch to modify the `ThemeToggle.tsx` file by adding 'theme-dial' to the className for the rotating dial wrapper. I should confirm the current file content, as the user made recent edits. So, I'll use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to read both the TSX and CSS files before I apply the necessary changes.</details></think>

---

I'll add a shared-element view transition for the dial by assigning `view-transition-name` to the rotating dial and defining animations for `::view-transition-old(theme-dial)` and `::view-transition-new(theme-dial)` so the dial rotates visibly during the page-level view transition. I'll update the dial element in `ThemeToggle.tsx` and add the CSS rules in `globals.css`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering CSS transitions**

I'm thinking about how to enhance the rotating `<span>`. I want to animate the dial rotation in the overlay instead of just fading. I need to add specific CSS for this.

I see that using media queries for reduced motion preferences can help adjust animations. However, I need to use keyframes to apply transform rotations. It's a bit tricky because I can't directly specify transforms; instead, I should define the `animation-name` for proper animating. It's a neat challenge!
**Defining rotation keyframes**

I'm defining keyframes for the dial to rotate in and out. The keyframes start at 180 degrees for entering and go to 0 degrees for exiting, and vice versa for the exit animation.

Hmm, I need to be cautious because if the dial is already in a rotation state (0 or 180), using keyframes could cause a double rotation effect. The view transitions use pseudo-elements that represent the state before and after, which may not include the live element's rotation during the transition. Maybe I should exclude the live dial from root view transitions for clarity?
**Implementing view transitions**

I see that there’s a property `view-transition-name: none` to exclude elements, but excluding would hide the dial under the overlay. The element would be part of the root bitmaps and not visible. The spec assigns elements as 'auto' by default, which means I need to set a shared name for them to appear on top. 

I'll add a class like 'theme-dial' for the rotating span, plus a performance hint with 'will-change-transform'. In CSS, I’ll specify `.theme-dial { view-transition-name: theme-dial; }` and define rules like `::view-transition-group(theme-dial)` to control isolation. It’s all about managing the layering correctly!
**Animating transitions with keyframes**

I’m thinking about how to control the joint transitions using pseudo-elements. I’ll animate the old and new versions of the dial with keyframes I need to define. The old dial rotates from 0 to 180 degrees as it rotates out, while the new dial will rotate from -180 to 0 degrees.

The direction of the rotation matters when toggling between light and dark modes. Clicking will always increase the rotation by 180 degrees clockwise. I want to ensure that the transformations are centered, so I’ll set the `transform-origin` to center center. It’s all about keeping things consistent!
**Configuring animations and transitions**

I’m figuring out how to apply transformations for my dial animations. The new snapshot will start at -180 degrees and go to 0 degrees, while the old one rotates from 0 to 180 degrees. This keeps the rotations consistent. 

I need to ensure that the animation duration is set to 700ms, matching the CSS for smooth transitions. Additionally, setting the `view-transition-name` in CSS will help with layering. I should also add `pointer-events: none` to let clicks pass through during the animations while ensuring the dial's performance remains intact. It's an exciting challenge!
**Implementing theme dial updates**

I’m planning to update `ThemeToggle.tsx` so the rotating `<span>` includes the 'theme-dial' class. I'll also add some inline styles and a corresponding CSS block in `globals.css` for the view transition.

The keyframes should ideally be outside the media query for clarity. It seems I can use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to apply both CSS and TSX updates concurrently, which fits with the spec's preference for parallelization. However, I might need to wrap state updates in `flushSync` to ensure the rotation snapshot appears correctly, ensuring the dial's animation aligns visually. So, I'll proceed with these changes, keeping everything organized and in compliance with guidelines.
**Preparing to implement patches**

I'm ready to tackle the changes for `ThemeToggle.tsx`. I need to add `flushSync` from 'react-dom' to the imports, update the rotating `<span>` to include the 'theme-dial' class, and wrap `setTheme` and `setRotation` inside `flushSync` within the `startViewTransition` block.

For the CSS, I’ll add a block under the existing view-transition root that details how the `theme-dial` will function. It looks like I'm aligning everything with the current indentation and keeping lints in check. After that, I'll provide a status update and apply my changes in parallel.</details></think>

---

I’m going to implement a shared-element View Transition for the dial: add a `view-transition-name` to the rotating dial in `ThemeToggle.tsx`, define animations for `::view-transition-old(theme-dial)`/`::view-transition-new(theme-dial)` in `globals.css`, and ensure React state is flushed during the view transition so the “after” snapshot captures the rotated dial.

- I added a shared-element View Transition for the dial:
  - Assigned `view-transition-name: theme-dial` to the dial container and used `flushSync` inside `startViewTransition` to ensure the “after” snapshot contains the updated rotation.
  - Added CSS for `::view-transition-old(theme-dial)` and `::view-transition-new(theme-dial)` to rotate out/in during the root transition.

Please test:
- While in dark mode, toggle to light: the moon should rotate out as the sun rotates in during the cross-fade, not after. If timing feels off we can tweak the 700ms duration or easing.

that breaks the animiation.

Clicking the toggle shows the hidden icons and duplicates both icons

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5-high)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing view transitions**

I'm looking into the issue where adding view-transition-name to the dial leads to duplicate icons and hidden elements. It seems that in shared element view transitions, cloning elements for animation can cause old and new snapshots to overlay. If the element alternates between the sun and moon, visible duplicates might appear. To manage this, we could decouple the rotating dial's inner icons from snapshots. Standard transitions do result in old and new snapshots rotating concurrently, which might further contribute to duplications.
**Understanding view transitions**

The view transition feature automatically crossfades between states, but if the element is shared, hidden live elements can complicate things. The browser typically hides the live element while rendering snapshots, yet duplicates might appear if CSS isn't targeting them correctly or if view transition nodes are mis-sized. The dial, as a container for icons, may reveal hidden icons that fall outside the circular viewport. The overflow needs to be clipped to ensure the display works smoothly during the view transition.
**Fixing view transition issues**

The shared element in the view transition focuses solely on the element itself. If clipping is set on a parent, the 'overflow-hidden' won’t affect snapshot pseudo-elements since they render on top. This is relevant for the dial because the overflow clipping should come from its immediate ancestor: the circular cutout with 'overflow-hidden' and rounded edges. Since the theme-dial snapshots aren't clipped within the parent's bounds, both icons remain visible. To resolve this, I should apply the view transition to the wrapper element that facilitates the overflow clipping instead of the dial itself.
**Addressing rotation and clipping**

I want the dial to rotate, but since the snapshots pertain to the clip container as the shared element, I need to be careful. I can animate the rotation of the snapshots, but the shape might rotate along with its mask. To get around this, I could nest a wrapper with a view-transition-name for the theme-dial and include the clipping. The snapshot area of a shared element is based on its bounding box, so I must ensure that view-transition-name is applied to a container that encompasses both the clip and the dial. This way, the clipping will be effective while the snapshot reflects both elements accurately.
**Resolving dial rotation and clipping**

I need to assign the view-transition-name to the element that includes the mask or clipping while ensuring the live element doesn't render to avoid duplicates. The default step hides captured elements, but if the view-transition-name isn't unique, duplicates can appear. To solve this, I'll move the 'theme-dial' class to the overflow-hidden container, which will allow the snapshot to include the clip.

I want to animate the inner dial's rotation, while ensuring the cutout remains static. Alternatively, I can apply clip-path to the dial element to maintain masking during transitions. The key is to ensure animations yield a seamless rotation visual.
**Addressing layout and clip path issues**

I need to handle possible duplicates outside the snapshot and ensure the live element’s transforms don’t interfere. The default view transition hides captured elements, but there's the risk of duplicates if I don't apply a unique 'view-transition-name'. I must also be careful with snapshot rotation; it shouldn’t conflict with the dial’s rotation. The solution lies in applying a clip-path to the pseudo-elements to show only the desired icon. Additionally, I’ll need to keep the snapshot positioned correctly relative to the dial's clip area during animations.
**Calculating clip path and layout**

I need to position the dial correctly so that the sun icon aligns with the top of the cutout. The dial's dimensions are 80 px, with top and left offsets calculated based on the container. This means I can set a clip-path for the snapshot at precise pixel coordinates, but I realize absolute pixels can be tricky. 

Instead, I can move the 'view-transition-name' to the overflow container while keeping the dial's rotation functional. I should only show the clipped content in the snapshots, ensuring no duplicates are visible. This setup allows for a clean transition while keeping the design consistent.
**Updating ThemeToggle functionality**

I'm planning to revert the 'theme-dial' class from the dial span and add it to the clip container instead. After updating the JSX, I’ll ensure the CSS for the view transition remains unchanged while applying 'contain: paint' to the new class. I want to add a clip path to maintain the circular shape; this might involve applying 'border-radius: 9999px' for correct clipping in the snapshots. I need to make sure the transitions are consistent, and the animation timing aligns to prevent any overlay issues. Finally, I will confirm usage of imported functions to keep things tidy!</details></think>

---

I'll move the shared-element marker to the clipped container to keep the mask in the snapshot and add circular clipping to the view-transition pseudo-elements to prevent the hidden icons from showing, then run a quick lint check.

- I moved the shared-element to the clipped 7x7 circular window so the snapshot keeps the mask, and I added circular clipping on the `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements to prevent duplicate/hidden icons from leaking outside the circle.
- The rotating dial itself remains inside that window, so rotation should appear correctly during the root view transition.

Please test the toggle again. If the dial still duplicates or leaks, I’ll switch to a more surgical approach: isolate only the icon stack as the shared element and keep the clipping on the pseudo-elements.

_**User (2025-10-07 15:45Z)**_

the icons just rotate in place now and overlap each other during rotation

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5-high)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It seems expected that I should mimic the dial moving, yet it appears the user perceives them as rotating in place and overlapping each other. That's an interesting perspective! I wonder if this could affect how they understand the functionality. I’ll need to consider how to communicate the expected interaction clearly. It's crucial to ensure the user’s perception aligns with what I’m trying to convey in this design. Let's refine how it’s presented for clarity.
It seems the pseudo-elements have the same 'clip-path circle' mask and 'position center' settings. Since there’s no cross slide along the path, they'll overlay each other. The dial effect isn't causing translation; it rotates around its own center while the icons are positioned at the top and bottom. The window is masked, showing the changing icons during rotation. For a better effect, I need to animate the internal dial instead of the window. The dial should be the shared element, clipped to the mask to prevent showing both icons.
The advanced approach is to apply a view-transition name to the dial element while defining a `clip-path` on the pseudo-elements to mimic the window mask. Keeping the dial as the shared element is key because it rotates within its own transform path. I need the pseudo-elements clipped to the 7x7 circle area with a matching CSS `clip-path`. Since pseudo-elements are independent, they may not detect the mask's bounding box, but I can still set their `clip-path` properties accordingly. The dial is absolutely positioned in the 20x20 container, while the mask is the narrower 7x7 window, so I’ll adjust the clipping as needed.
Okay, so the pseudo-elements are O(N) and they're linked to the top-level document, reflecting the bounding box of the shared dial element. The dial itself has a bounding box of 20x20, while the 7x7 window is positioned above it. I need to set the clip to a circle at 50% 50% with a radius of 3.5 to mask within the 20x20 space. However, I need the clipping area to match the smaller viewport circle, since it’s smaller than the dial's bounding box. Plus, I should consider the dial's offset, specifically translating it on the Y-axis.
I’m considering how we set the positions with top-2 left-1/2. The 7x7 is inside a 10x10 circle, and the relative positions are dynamic. It might be simpler to have separate view transitions for the dial and the window, but they need unique names. I realized that when we set the view transition on the container, the dial’s animation fails because it changes but the shared element is the container. To show the dial rotation, I need to animate the pseudo-elements rather than rely on the real DOM. However, if I don’t set the transforms on them, the content doesn’t update properly. I need to mark the dial as the shared element while applying a clip to the pseudo-elements. This should help avoid unnatural overlaps, allowing the two icons to blend smoothly as they rotate in and out.
I see that we previously tried assigning `.theme-dial` to the dial, which led to some duplication issues due to pseudo-elements not being clipped. Now, I'm back to implementing clipping for the dial. It’s important to put the `view-transition-name` on the dial element and keep the CSS for clipping snapshots to the window circle. However, I need to consider the positioning offsets. The clipping path will be complex, but I might simplify things by using a `view-transition-group` to layer elements. 

Alternatively, I could exclude the dial from being captured in the transition snapshots, allowing it to rotate live above the overlay. There are also possibilities to manage z-index layering for better visibility. I’ll need to ensure everything is aligned to create a smooth visual effect.
I realize the best way to show the dial above is by using `position: fixed` with a higher stacking; but since pseudo-elements are on top, I need to animate the dial as a shared element. I’ll set the `view-transition-name` on the dial and animate it differently: rotating the old element to 180 and fading it out, while the new one fades in without rotating. 

The challenge is keeping them from overlapping, which is necessary for the cross-fade effect. I might consider adjusting timing functions or opacity to minimize perceived overlap. To make this work, I need to revert back to marking the dial as the shared element while ensuring the clip path is correctly applied to create a clean transition. I'll double-check the code to ensure everything is properly set up.
I'm considering repositioning the dial so that the small window is perfectly centered in its bounding box. This will help simplify the "clip-path" settings. I need to ensure that the moon and sun rotate out and in without overlapping too much within the window. The animation needs to show them as separate entities, not overlapping fiercely.

To do this, I'll set the `view-transition-name` on the dial while keeping the transitions smooth. I'll adjust the CSS to ensure everything clips properly, and I’ll make modifications to the transitions to match the timing and ensure clarity. The code needs to reflect these changes accurately.
I’m adjusting the `clip-path` to use `circle(0.875rem at 50% 15px)`, which translates to 14 px with a 16 px root. This will help maintain the 80 px to 28 px ratio in Tailwind consistently. I’ll set the transform origin to 50% 50% and make all animation durations match at 1000ms. Even with these changes, there might still be some overlap during rotation, but it should now appear as a more natural rotation rather than just icons overlapping at the center.

I’m going to move the shared-element transition from the clipped 7x7 window to the rotating dial itself, and clip the view-transition snapshots to the circular viewport so the dial rotates through the window without showing hidden parts. Then I’ll lint the files.

- I moved the shared-element name back to the rotating dial and clipped the view-transition snapshots with a circular `clip-path` sized/positioned to the visible 7x7 window, so only the portion inside the viewport window is rendered during the transition. This should prevent overlapping/duplicate icons and make the dial appear to rotate through the window.

Please test the toggle again. If the clip sizing looks off on your screen density, I can adjust the `clip-path` circle radius/offset to match exactly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing rotation effects**

I need to animate a pseudo-element's rotation from -180 to 0. However, I previously added keyframes that caused duplication since the dial is updating its rotation state while the pseudo-element rotates too. This led to both a snapshot overlay and a live element displaying simultaneously. In view transitions, the old and new snapshots should fade, but the live element should ideally be hidden. Duplicates appeared due to changes in the view-transition classes and clip path errors.
**Clarifying Shared Elements**

The spec suggests that only one element should act as a shared element during the transition. I need to set the view-transition-name on the cutout container and have its content rotate by updating the internal transform. To animate the rotation, I can align to it without updating the internal state simultaneously. If I animate the pseudo-element's rotation, I shouldn't change the internal dial's rotation. The live updated element must remain hidden until the transition completes, as view transitions manage that.
**Investigating Duplication Causes**

I think duplication might happen because I haven't set the right styles like 'contain: paint layout style' or 'isolation: isolate.' There could also be issues with 'mixed-blend-mode' affecting things. The 'clip-path' uses absolute coordinates based on the pseudo-element's bounding box, which is 80x80 if I attach the view-transition-name to the dial. This might misalign the circle I’m trying to create at the correct position. I need to ensure the clip-path accurately matches the dial's coordinate system to avoid clipping issues.
**Computing Layout Positioning**

Let's break this down. The container is sized 40x40, stated as 'relative inline-flex h-10 w-10', with an inner 'border-2 window' also at 40x40. The cutout is a 7x7 element positioned relatively within that window. Since the 'window' utilizes 'items-center justify-center', this means the 7x7 circle sits perfectly centered within the 40x40 space. The dial, however, is absolutely positioned relative to the 7x7 cutout, with specific offset values that allow it to align correctly within that 28x28 bounding box.
**Calculating Dial Rotation and Position**

I need to determine the position of the dial relative to its container. The top is set at 8px, while the left is centered. The dial's height is 80, making its center around 41px from the top of the container, which has a height of 28px. This means the cutout center is 14px down, placing the dial's center 27px lower than the cutout center. This positioning allows the circular path of icons to align correctly with the cutout as the dial rotates, which is important for the effect I'm aiming for.
**Updating Clip Path and Rotation Logic**

I'm focusing on setting the correct clip path relative to the dial's coordinates. The center of the cutout should be at (40 px, 13 px) instead of the earlier miscalculation. The clip path will be defined as 'circle(14px at 40px 13px),' ensuring everything aligns properly. I'll also add styles like 'contain: strict' to the dial to maintain visual integrity during transitions.

To avoid duplication, I need to ensure that the live dial behind doesn't create illusions when it rotates. Adding the correct properties, like 'mix-blend-mode: normal' and 'clip-path', should help keep everything organized. Then I'll update the CSS with these specifications.
**Patching Clip Path and Transform Origin**

I'm updating the clip path to better match the dial's box with 'circle(14px at 50% 16.25%)'. I want to ensure the transform origin remains at 50% to center the dial correctly. 

Before applying the patch, it’s essential to give a quick status update: "I’ll adjust the clip-path to align with the 7x7 viewport relative to the dial." 

I'll focus on keeping the message concise while confirming that all previous imports are in use. Now, I'll proceed to run the apply_patch command to `src/app/globals.css`.</details></think>

---

I'll correct the clipping by setting the view-transition pseudo-element clip-path to the exact circle location relative to the dial's 80x80 box, so only the 28px viewport is visible during the transition. Then I'll verify no linter issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing clipping issues**

I see that the user mentioned, "you did not fix the clipping at all." We recently modified the CSS clip-path to a circle definition, but it seems like the coordinate system for the ::view-transition-* pseudo elements might differ. This could mean that the clip path is indeed not correct due to the transform offsets of the dial element. I’ll need to focus on properly implementing option 2, which involves using the shared element view transition for the dial when the root view transition occurs.
**Structuring the viewport**

I need to clarify the structure here. First, there's an outer container that forms a 10x10 viewport. Inside, there's a static viewport window with a large circular cutout that’s 10 pixels high and wide. Then, there’s a circular cutout with class properties like relative positioning and z-index set to 20, which gives me a 7x7 viewport. Lastly, inside this, I have a rotating dial that's 20 pixels high and wide, positioned for rotation while being masked by the 7x7 window.
**Reassessing view transitions**

I realize that the snapshot of the dial alone doesn’t capture the container clipping. To preserve the clip, I should attach the view-transition-name to the 7x7 window element, but this caused duplicates before. It's likely due to the dial being inside the container, which results in both old and new states overlapping during the root transition. Instead of applying view transitions to the dial, I think it's better to keep the root view transition but exclude the dial so it remains live above the snapshots.
**Dealing with view transitions**

I see that using `viewTransitionName: none` allows me to opt-out for the element, but I still want to see the dial rotate. The previous issue stemmed from the root overlay covering the dial. If I mark the dial with the view-transition class and apply `contain` and `isolation`, that might not prevent the overlay from covering it since it's drawn above all content. The overlay replicates the root, but by setting `view-transition-name: none`, the overlay still obstructs the dial. I can try adjusting the z-index of the pseudo-elements, though I’m unsure how that might interact with the specs.
**Revising approach for dial rotation**

I’m considering an alternate approach using `document.startViewTransition`. I want to animate the dial within the pseudo-elements so it rotates in snapshot layers instead of live, as that caused issues with duplicate icons. The problem happens since the snapshot includes both top and bottom icons overlapping. To resolve this, I can avoid animating the entire dial with CSS transforms and keep the dial's state rotation unchanged while animating the pseudo-elements for a smoother effect. I’ll aim to ensure that only the necessary elements are visible during the transition without causing confusion from overlapping visuals.
**Refining dial implementation**

I need to implement the dial as a shared element with rotation animations while ensuring proper clipping. To show the old and new icons correctly, I’m thinking of splitting the dial into two separate shared elements: one for the moon and one for the sun. This setup would let me animate them independently and avoid overlap. Clipping them within the 7x7 viewport is important, so I'll compute the exact offsets to ensure they display correctly. The clip-path definition will need to center at the right coordinates to ensure everything stays aligned during transitions. This approach should lead to a smoother visual experience without confusion from overlapping icons during rotation.
**Ensuring precise animations**

I need to verify that the pseudo elements match the size of the dial element, as they'll take snapshots of it. Adjusting the `inset: 0` and setting the transform origin to the center is essential. It’s important only to show one icon at a time during transitions while allowing them to overlap partly. I'll implement precise rotations for both the old and new pseudo elements while keeping clipping accurate, updating the CSS to reflect this. Also, I'll ensure that the dial inside the live DOM doesn't interfere during transitions and properly implement any necessary code modifications for clarity.
**Updating clipping for precision**

To ensure the view transition name stays on the dial, I’ll check if `contain: layout paint` keeps the pseudo elements within the dial’s bounding box, which seems fine. I'll calculate the new clip center at 40px, 15px based on the dial's top position. It’s time to update our previous coordinates to pixel values instead of percentages. I need to make sure we’ve adhered to development guidelines and provide a minimal status update before applying the patch. Then, I’ll summarize the improvements clearly for the user. Let's get this patch implemented!</details></think>

---

I'll correct the clip-path to exact pixel coordinates relative to the dial's 80x80 box so the pseudo-element snapshots are masked precisely to the 28px circular viewport. Then I'll check for lints.

- I updated the view-transition mask to a precise pixel clip-path: `circle(14px at 40px 15px)` on `::view-transition-(old|new)(theme-dial)`, matching the 28px circular viewport within the 80x80 dial, so only the visible window shows during the transition.

Please test again. If alignment is still off by a few px on your environment, tell me whether the cutout appears slightly above/below/left/right during transition and I’ll nudge the center accordingly.

_**User (2025-10-07 15:45Z)**_

you continue to break things. current issues:

- clicking the toggle shows the hidden dial and icons
- when clicking the icons duplicated (e.g. 2 suns / 2 moons) after rotation completes, the correct icon replaces the incorrect one by popping in

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5-high)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing view transition issues**

I need to address the problems with shared element view transitions and the theme dial. The user pointed out that clicking the toggle reveals hidden dials and duplicates icons, like seeing two suns or moons. After rotation, the correct icon replaces the incorrect one. To fix this, I'll ensure we maintain the page-level view transition root cross fade and apply shared element transitions correctly. The duplication likely arises from both old and new states being visible simultaneously, which needs to be resolved.
**Reviewing view transitions**

I need to clarify how the View Transitions API works. While the transition runs, the DOM gets updated, and the user agent creates pseudo-elements as snapshots. The original DOM might still be present, but it uses view-transition rules to hide actual elements. Duplicates can appear if both old and new elements exist. To solve this, I should apply the same view-transition-name to elements in both states and hide the actual element during the transition using CSS, ensuring no duplicates are visible.
**Clarifying CSS for transitions**

I need to look closely at the recommended CSS for the view transitions. The setup includes `::view-transition-group(theme-dial) { z-index: 9999 }`, and I should set `.theme-dial { view-transition-name: theme-dial; }`, potentially adding `.theme-dial { contain: layout }`. To hide the live element, I might need to set `animation-duration: 0s` on `html::view-transition-image-pair(root)`. During transitions, the actual elements stay in the DOM, but the user agent suppresses rendering, which is causing duplication issues with visible snapshots.
**Resolving overlapping icons**

It looks like the overlapping of old and new icons is due to our keyframes causing both to rotate in place. The clip path issues reveal hidden icons that shouldn't be visible. We applied the view-transition-name to the dial container, but we also need it applied correctly to the element with 'overflow-hidden' to manage overflow properly. The duplication issue suggests that the overlay pseudo elements aren't clipped correctly. One alternative could be to create two separate shared elements: one for the sun icon and one for the moon icon.
**Optimizing view transition with CSS**

I need to clarify how to optimize the view transitions for the dial. It looks like using pseudo-elements like `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` could help manage visibility. By setting their opacity correctly, I can ensure only one element is visible at a time. 

I should consider animating just the new snapshot while quickly hiding the old one to avoid duplicates. Using `image-pair` and adjusting cross-fade settings might help prevent both icons from appearing simultaneously, creating a smoother transition. Setting high z-index and using clip-path for positioning could further refine this effect.
**Refining CSS for transitions**

I'm diving into the CSS for the 'theme-dial' element, focusing on how to properly utilize pseudo-elements for smoother transitions. It looks like I should implement a `clip-path` that appropriately matches the dial coordinates to avoid overlap and duplication. I need to ensure that I set the `z-index` for overlays to be higher, and control opacity effectively to hide the old transitions.

I also want to properly manage the `transition` properties, ensuring the underlying dial doesn't animate during view transitions, which requires some adjustments in the toggle function. Overall, it’s about finding the right balance for a seamless transition experience!
**Updating transition CSS**

I'm focusing on the CSS updates for the `theme-dial` element. I need to set `::view-transition-new(theme-dial)` to use a rotation animation from `-180deg` to `0deg`. To prevent duplicates, I must ensure both the old and new states transition correctly. 

Adding a `z-index` and configuring isolation will help manage the overlay properly. I’ll also need to implement a toggle for the `vt-active` class to control transitions effectively. Finally, I have to maintain a fallback for users with reduced motion preferences. Time to implement these changes!</details></think>

---

I’ll update the view transition to avoid duplicating overlays by only animating the new snapshot, hiding the old snapshot, and elevating the dial’s transition layer above the root fade. I’ll also disable the dial’s base transform transition during the view transition and adjust CSS accordingly, then update the code to add/remove a temporary class while the transition runs.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring view transitions**

I'm thinking about the `view-transition-name` property and how it affects elements during animations. If not specified, the element becomes part of the root capture. To animate shared elements, I need to set a name. I realize that overlays can duplicate because both the live DOM and pseudo elements are visible, so I have to hide the live content during transitions to prevent duplication. The specs say the old and new states go into pseudo elements that fade out once the transition finishes.
**Clarifying content changes**

I'm thinking about what happens when an element changes from sun to moon, and how rotating with React state could cause duplicates. The live content might still update and show below the overlay, which is a normal pop-in effect. There's an issue with the pseudo-element clipping incorrectly when I try to confine it to a 28px circle. I may need to adjust how I use `.theme-dial`. It might help to apply `view-transition-name` to a wrapper that matches the cutout</details></think>
