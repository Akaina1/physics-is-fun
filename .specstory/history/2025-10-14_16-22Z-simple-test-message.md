I'm here to help! I can see you're working on a physics simulation project with Kerr black hole calculations. You currently have the `integration.rs` file open.

Could you please let me know what you'd like me to help you with? For example:

- Do you have a question about the code?
- Are you encountering an error or issue?
- Would you like me to review or explain something?
- Do you need help implementing a feature?

Just let me know what you need, and I'll be happy to assist!
